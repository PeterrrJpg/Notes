# Access Networks

**Access Network** is network that physically connects an end system to the first router(aka *edge router*) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.

## DSL(Digital Subscriber Line)

- Uses *existing* telephone line to central office DSLAM(Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer)
  - Data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
  - Voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net

## Cable-based access
- Uses *frequency division multiplexing*(different channels transmitted in different frequencccy bands)
- HFC: hybrid fiber coax
  - asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps â€“ 1.2 Gbs downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps
upstream transmission rate 
- Network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
  - homes *share acccess network* to cable headend unlike DSL, which has dedicated access to central office

## Fiber to the home/premise/curb
- Fully optical fiber path all the way to the home
  - e.g. NBN, Google, Verizon FIOS
  - ~30 Mbps to 1Gbps   

## Wirelesss access networks
- Shared *wireless* access network connects end system to router via basse station(aka *access point*)
- Wireless local area networks(WLANs)
  - typically within or around building (~100 ft)
  - 802.11b/g/n (WiFi): 11, 54, 450 Mbps transmission rate 
- Wide-area cellular access networks
  - provided by mobile, cellular network operator
  - 10's Mbps

## Enterprise networks
- Companies, universities, etc.
- mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and routers
  - **Ethernet**: wired access at 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps 
  - **WiFi**: wireless access points at 11, 54, 450 Mbps
